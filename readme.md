# Atticus Robinson Portfolio

## Purpose

This page will be used to host and display my work, both photography and webpages. 

## Challenges & Resources Used

My biggest challenge in creating this page was the hero background image. I really wanted to use a fixed background but had difficulty getting the hero to size correctly. I found help with a few online resources. The current solution is not perfect but I think it works well on most mediums.
